# Automated Human - Wildlife Monitoring System using Deep Learning

## ABSTRACT
In many real-life applications animal detections-based research is very essential. Methods for 
animal detection are helpful to know about the moving behavioural of targeted animal and to 
prevent animal intrusion that result dangerous situations in forest border area. Human animal 
conflict creates lot of negative impact for both human and wild animal. Crop damage caused 
by animal attacks is one of the major threats in reducing the crop yield. Due to the expansion 
of cultivated land into previous wildlife habitat, crop raiding is becoming one of the most 
antagonizing human-wildlife conflicts. Farmers in India face serious threats from pests, natural 
calamities & damage by animals resulting in lower yields. Traditional methods followed by 
farmers are not that effective and it is not feasible to hire guards to keep an eye on crops and 
prevent wild animals. Since safety of both human and animal is equally vital, it is important to 
protect the crops from damage caused by animal as well as divert the animal without any harm. 
So, there is a need of developing a system which detect any presence of interactions of wild 
animal in the border region and without causing any harmful effect to human being and wild 
animal the interference and the dangerous situations caused by the wild animal have to be 
minimized. This project covers various perspective of the design of such systems, including 
image processing and artificial intelligence for animal detection, species classification, 
automatic identification of animal using Yolov3, a pretrained CNN model and design of alarm unit using Bolt IoT WiFi Module.

## INTRODUCTION
Human-wildlife conflict requires striking a balance between conservation of wild-animal and the needs of people who live with wildlife. Urbanization of our society has increased the personal interaction between human and wildlife. The problematic result is that our society is causing more problems from wildlife but becoming less concerned about the well-being of wildlife species. So, this project mainly aims forest border security which will consider well-being of both humans in the border region and wild animals. Here develops wildlife monitoring tool based on YOLOv3 and an animal repellent circuit. When the system detects the presence of animal it produces an alarm to inform the people and the forest rangers. So here further a system is designed which helps to repel animal back to the forest. Ultrasonic sensor is used for this purpose. We know that an ultrasonic sensor continuously produces ultrasonic wave. The frequency of ultrasonic wave is about 40 kHz, which is beyond the audible range of human being and animal can easily hear this sound. Which create a hostile and noisy environment for the animal and by hearing this noisy sound animal get repel back to the forest.
